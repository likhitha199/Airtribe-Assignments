                    As the founder of Petzbe, she conceptualized and steered the development of an app, crafted the brand and marketing strategy, and built a pet parent community with hundreds of thousands of users.
                    Prior to Petzbe, she worked in various start-ups from their inception, developing communication and marketing strategies. She has a MSc in Public Relations and Corporate Communication from New York University,
                    and a BSc in Marketing and Communication Design from Webster University. She's from Stockholm, Sweden, but has lived in NYC for the past 10 years. It was her Brussels Griffon Angus, Co-CEO of Petzbe, that got her into the pet industry. 
                    Andrea is on a mission to make Petzbe the largest pet-eco system & household name for the hundreds of millions of pet parents worldwide, where they can explore everything pet-related, tail to nose! üêæ‚ú®
